# Group-Leaver
A discord tool, to leave groups automatically! As of 12/24/2023 this has been updated!

1. Download the repo, make sure to run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` as it needs Discord.py 1.7.3 to work and if you just install the latest version it will not work!
2. Get your discord token. if you dont know how to do that, you probably shouldn't be messing around with stuff like this.
3. Put token in token variable (its commented)
4. Run script
5. Enter the prefix and command you set in the script to run the command. ( IF YOU HAVE OVER 100 JUST BE AWARE YOU MAY HAVE TO RUN IT MORE THAN ONCE.)
